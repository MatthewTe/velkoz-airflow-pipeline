class ExternalDatabase(models.Model):
    """
    A django database model that is meant to represent an external database that
    the application is connected to.

    The methodâ€™s primary purpose is two fold:

    * It is used to dynamically generate front-end elements based on collected
        database metadata.

    * It is used to create a database URI which is used by various APIs to connect
        and extract data from said database.

    The __str__ internal method is also used to dynamically create front-end hrefs
    based on the associated name (same as the __str__ value) django view name.
    eg: {% url 'example_django_view_name_containing__str__' %}.


    A database URI is structured as follows:
    [database_type]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]

    Attributes:
        db_type (models.CharField): A string meant to represent the database type.

        user (models.CharField): A string representing a username for an account
            of the database represented by the model instance.

        password (models.CharField): A string representing the password for the
            database represented by the model instance. # TODO: Make this secure as a hashed password.

        host (models.CharField): A string representing the host of the database
            represented by the model instance. The host is either a direct string
            eg: 'localhost' or a string such as '127.0.0.1:8000'.

        port (models.CharField): A string representing the port of the
            database represented by the model instance. Port Numbers are between
            0 - 65535. Ports are stored as a string because database URIs are
            compiled as a string.

        db_name (models.CharField): A string representing the specific database name
            for the specific database represented by the model instance.
